# Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) Bus Delay Time Analytics Report from January 2023 – September 2023 – written by Kenji Niyokindi

# Introduction 

The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) serves as a government agency responsible for providing public transportation to about 1.7 million daily commuters in Toronto and its surrounding regions. The primary objective of the TTC is to establish, oversee, and maintain an extensive public transportation system in Toronto, which stands as the most comprehensive public transit network in Canada and ranks third in North America. The TTC provides its services through an extensive network of subways, streetcars, and buses, while also overseeing parking facilities at its subway stations.

Nonetheless, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) grapples with a significant challenge: bus delays. To address this issue, a comprehensive analysis of TTC bus delay data for 2023 (spanning from January to September) has been undertaken, utilizing information made available through the Toronto City's Open Data Portal.

The objectives of this report are as follows:
1. Identifying the peak times during the day when delays are most pronounced.
2. Calculating the average delay duration in minutes for each hour.
3. Determining the primary causes of delays.
4. Quantifying the total hours of delays incurred.
5. Pinpointing the most affected travel directions.
6. Identify the specific buses that experience mechanical issues most frequently.

The overarching purpose of this report is to furnish stakeholders with vital insights that can be harnessed to address the issue of bus delays and enhance the overall efficiency of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) service.


# Report Summary

The data analysis reveals a cumulative delay duration of 13,937 hours since the start of the year, resulting in passengers collectively waiting for buses for a total of 36,324 hours. On average, these delays equate to a waiting time of 21 minutes per delay incident.

Further examination of the data underscores that the majority of delays tend to occur between 3 pm and 5 pm, reaching a peak of 2,805 delay incidents at 4 pm this year. This is not an ideal scenario as this timeframe coincides with peak commuting hours when many individuals are concluding their workday. Additionally, most bus delays transpire on weekdays, with Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday experiencing the highest frequency of delays. Notably, the lengthiest delays tend to manifest at 2 am, averaging a 29-minute delay duration during this time.

Mechanical issues emerge as the primary culprits behind delays, accounting for 35% of the most common sources of disruptions in bus services. Conversely, the most protracted delays are triggered by buses necessitating route diversions, amassing a total delay duration of 110 minutes. Among the various directions, northbound (N) experiences the most substantial impact, with a staggering 9,114 delays occurring in this direction. Southbound (S) closely follows with 8,490 delays. Notably, bus #1085 stands out as the most plagued by mechanical issues, signaling a need for its replacement, as well as a closer examination of other buses exhibiting similar patterns.

In summary, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC plays a vital role in serving over a million passengers in Toronto, and while delays are an inevitability given this large volume of riders, this analysis illuminates key trends and patterns within these delays. Armed with these insights, the next crucial step is to formulate actionable strategies to ameliorate the situation and furnish the people of Toronto with the highest caliber of service.
